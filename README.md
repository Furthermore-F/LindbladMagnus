# Variational Lindblad with Magnus Expansion

## QSD_SME_VQA

Building on the close relationship between nonlinearly unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic
Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum
state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction
trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our
algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time
steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics
in terms of the ensemble average.
